# watchme

This is the code I use on my [Watchy by SQFMI](<https://watchy.sqfmi.com/> "Watchy by SQFMI").

A word of warning : this is constant WIP and only matches my use cases :-)

Also some files should be edited to match your own personal data (qr code, urls, WiFi AP and passwords...).

I started from the sample code from [SQFMI Github](<https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy> "SQFMI Github").
I also remember borrowing some code from Github and hack it to make my default basic face, but cannot remember where. If you think that was your code and want some credits, please tell me and I will link your code and credit your work appropriately.

TODO / WIP:
- [ ] Schedule automatic NTP update after daytime savings
- [ ] Groceries / shopping list sync
- [ ] TOTP
- [ ] WiFi Scanning
- [ ] Bluetooth media management

As a final word, I use [PlatformIO](<https://platformio.org/> "PlatformIO") to build and [Emacs](<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/> "GNU Emacs") as IDE.
